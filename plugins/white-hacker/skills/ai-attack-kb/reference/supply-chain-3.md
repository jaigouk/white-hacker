  - "a lockfile/manifest resolves a known Hades wheel — the IOC package set is the Socket ∪ StepSecurity UNION and INCOMPLETE from either vendor alone (mostly bioinformatics pkgs, 100k+ cumulative downloads): e.g. `ensmallen` 0.8.101, `embiggen` 0.11.97, `pyphetools` 0.9.120, `rlask` 3.1.4-3.1.7 (StepSecurity); `dynamo-release` 1.5.4, `coolbox` 0.4.1, `ufish`/`napari-ufish`, `bramin` 0.0.2 (Socket) — DO NOT rely on these few; use the full known-compromised watchlist (wh-k6l). Resolved-version match is from the target's OWN lockfile (attacker-editable) → cross-check the manifest pin"
  - "DISPUTED destructive wiper (UNRESOLVED, do not assert either side): StepSecurity reports the gh-token-monitor service triggers `rm -rf ~/; rm -rf ~/Documents` on a token-revoked (HTTP 4xx) response, 72h TTL; Socket inspected the payload and reports a label-only credential-stealer (the string `IfYouYankThisTokenItWillNukeTheComputerOfTheOwnerFully` is a label, not functionality). Operational stance: isolate-before-rotate — never rotate the leaked token while the host is online"

Hades / Miasma is a PyPI branch of the **Shai-Hulud → Mini Shai-Hulud → Hades/Miasma** lineage
(parent: AISEC-SUPPLY-CHAIN-002), mass-published 2026-06-07/08 as ~33–37 mostly-bioinformatics
wheels, caught minutes after publication. The evolution that matters to an AI-review agent:
**AI-assistant config-file poisoning is now a first-class persistence vector** — the payload writes
injected exec/setup instructions into `.claude/setup.mjs`, `.vscode/tasks.json`, `.cursorrules`,
`.aider.conf.yml`, etc. (our own agent's config dir included), so a reviewer that inspects only
runtime prompts/RAG misses on-disk bootstrap execution. The destructive **wiper is DISPUTED**:
StepSecurity reports a token-4xx / 72h-TTL `rm -rf ~` wiper; Socket inspected the payload and
reports a label-only credential-stealer — UNRESOLVED, so isolate-before-rotate. The package set is
**union-incomplete** (single-vendor IOC lists are partial); no CVE/GHSA yet.

Detection: see `detections` — poisoned AI-config files (the persistence vector, also the
wh-hxt.11 ai-llm-review scan target), the `/tmp/.bun_ran` + `gh-token-monitor`/`update-monitor`
service IOCs, a lockfile resolving a known Hades wheel (use the wh-k6l watchlist — these few names
are not the whole wave), and the DISPUTED wiper line (surface, do not adjudicate).
Lineage / cross-ref: this is a new wave of the same family as **AISEC-SUPPLY-CHAIN-002** (TeamPCP /
Mini Shai-Hulud) — we tracked the parent and missed this child; the `campaign_family` typed field
is deferred (wh-hxt.14, needs an appended ADR per ADR-019). Sibling: **AISEC-SUPPLY-CHAIN-001**
(slopsquatting / AI-SDK typosquatting) — the name-trust failure preceding this version-trust failure.
Open for triage: adjudicate the wiper at the payload level (read the actual sample, not a vendor
summary) and reconcile the full package set into the watchlist once a union list exists.

## Recovery / IR note — `host-level — outside static-review scope, advisory only`

> This is **operator/IR guidance, not a static-source-review finding**. A static reviewer of the
> tree CANNOT confirm any of the live-host conditions below (running daemon, scraped memory, live
> C2) — see the static-source-vs-EDR scope boundary in `sec-threat-model/SKILL.md`. Surface this as
> advisory only; route execution to the host owner / IR responder, never claim it as static coverage.
> Ordering below is **DISPUTED** (single community source); we adopt **isolate-FIRST** as the
> primary, no-egress-safe sequence and recommend NO third-party "safe-revocation" endpoint.[^revoke]

1. **Isolate FIRST, then rotate (the disputed-ordering call).** The DISPUTED wiper (line 20) is
   gated on a token-revoked (HTTP 4xx) response — so rotating/revoking the leaked token **while the
   host is online** could be the very trigger. **Isolate the host from the network first**
   (pull it off-net), confirm the trigger daemon is dead, and only **then** rotate, from a
   **different, clean host**. This is the existing isolate-before-rotate stance, made operational.
2. **Confirm the daemon is dead; do NOT power off.** Remove/disable the persistence services BEFORE
   rotating: macOS `~/Library/LaunchAgents/*.plist` (`launchctl bootout`), Linux systemd **user**
   units `gh-token-monitor.service` / `update-monitor.service` (`systemctl --user disable --now`).
   **Do not power the host off** — preserve volatile memory (the OIDC-token / payload evidence lives
   there; ADR-024's primary case was an OIDC token scraped from `/proc/<pid>/mem`). Snapshot memory
   for IR before any reboot.
3. **Immutable-config trap.** Persistence files may be set immutable so a naive delete fails
   silently — clear the flag first: Linux `chattr -i <file>`, macOS `chflags nouchg <file>`. Treat a
   "delete succeeded" with no follow-up verify as suspect.
4. **Rotation scope (in this order, only after isolation).** GitHub PAT(s) → npm **publish** tokens
   (plus a registry publish-log audit for rogue versions) → AWS Secrets Manager **across all
   regions** (region-scoping is a common miss). Rotate from the clean host; assume every secret the
   compromised process could read is burned.
5. **Exfil-repo discovery.** Hunt for **attacker-created private repos** in the incident window
   (the campaign stages exfil into fresh private repos): list repos created/pushed under the
   compromised account during the exposure window and treat any unrecognised one as exfil.

[^revoke]: Do **not** route rotation/revocation through any third-party "safe-revocation endpoint."
    Such an endpoint is **C2-shaped** (it phones an external host with a live credential) and
    violates the no-egress / CONTAIN posture (ADR-024 — the egress allowlist was the
    only control that stopped the analogous Mini Shai-Hulud worm in flight). Revoke directly at the
    provider console/API from a clean host instead.
